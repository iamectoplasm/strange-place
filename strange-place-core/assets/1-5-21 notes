- characters live on map???????????
- so have map config file that contains entity info-- which entity exists, where they start,
	if there's crops growing??????????
	
- when a new map gets brought up need to deserialize all the info of entities that live on it


- what does the MapManager do what do i do



- okay so like instead of using map location classes to load npcs in, instead read json file associated w/
	specific map being called
- like seriously.... why am i using java classes for that. i think that's a holdover from the book i was following???




- JSON FILES JSON FILES REPLACE THE WEIRD STUFF WITH JSON FILES
