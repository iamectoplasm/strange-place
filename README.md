I'm using LibGDX to make a RPG game as a fun side project!

Building it up based off of the book Mastering LibGDX Game Development by Patrick Hoey

Nintendo, I know I am using your sprites because I am but a simple programmer who cannot for the life of her create art, so please forgive me. I'm using all this as practice, not for the purpose of making money or claiming any of the art as my own!
