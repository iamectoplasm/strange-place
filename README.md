I'm using LibGDX to make a RPG game that no one else wants (except for me) mostly to practice my coding and logic-ing in between being busy w/ computer science degree in university

Building it up based off of the book Mastering LibGDX Game Development by Patrick Hoey

nintendo i know im using your sprites, for i am a programmer and not an artist, pls dont sue
